A student-project about a website called Click & Ship is a shopping application that aims to showcase local and startup
businesses in the Philippines. Users may opt to create a shop in their account wherein
they can add information about their shop and upload items for sale. Shop owners
may edit the information for their posts or completely delete them. Users may add to
their cart, buy items, and add comments to posts.

# To Fix
1. The web app allows the user to order quantities beyond the stock of an item.
2. The web app should remove the item if there is no stock.
3. Checkout feature could have been more comprehensive.
4. No edit comment feature.
5. Delete comment feature appears only after refreshing the page.
